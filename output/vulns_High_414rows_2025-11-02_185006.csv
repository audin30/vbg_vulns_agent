  - This release contains fixes for two security problems; one critical and one minor. 1) Race condition in     sshd(8) A critical vulnerability in sshd(8) was present in Portable OpenSSH versions between 8.5p1 and     9.7p1 (inclusive) that may allow arbitrary code execution with root privileges. Successful exploitation     has been demonstrated on 32-bit Linux/glibc systems with ASLR. Under lab conditions; the attack requires     on average 6-8 hours of continuous connections up to the maximum the server will accept. Exploitation on     64-bit systems is believed to be possible but has not been demonstrated at this time. It's likely that     these attacks will be improved upon. Exploitation on non-glibc systems is conceivable but has not been     examined. Systems that lack ASLR or users of downstream Linux distributions that have modified OpenSSH to     disable per-connection ASLR re-randomisation (yes - this is a thing; no - we don't understand why) may     potentially have an easier path to exploitation. OpenBSD is not vulnerable. We thank the Qualys Security     Advisory Team for discovering; reporting and demonstrating exploitability of this problem; and for     providing detailed feedback on additional mitigation measures. 2) Logic error in ssh(1)     ObscureKeystrokeTiming In OpenSSH version 9.5 through 9.7 (inclusive); when connected to an OpenSSH server     version 9.5 or later; a logic error in the ssh(1) ObscureKeystrokeTiming feature (on by default) rendered     this feature ineffective - a passive observer could still detect which network packets contained real     keystrokes when the countermeasure was active because both fake and real keystroke packets were being sent     unconditionally. This bug was Daniel Hugenroth and Alastair Beresford of the University of Cambridge     Computer Lab. Worse; the unconditional sending of both fake and real keystroke packets broke another long-     standing timing attack mitigation. Since OpenSSH 2.9.9 sshd(8) has sent fake keystoke echo packets for     traffic received on TTYs in echo-off mode; such as when entering a password into su(8) or sudo(8). This     bug rendered these fake keystroke echoes ineffective and could allow a passive observer of a SSH session     to once again detect when echo was off and obtain fairly limited timing information about keystrokes in     this situation (20ms granularity by default). This additional implication of the bug was identified by     Jacky Wei En Kung; Daniel Hugenroth and Alastair Beresford and we thank them for their detailed analysis.

  - When curl is asked to use HSTS; the expiry time for a subdomain might overwrite a parent domain's cache     entry; making it end sooner or later than otherwise intended. This affects curl using applications that     enable HSTS and use URLs with the insecure `HTTP://` scheme and perform transfers with hosts like     `x.example.com` as well as `example.com` where the first host is a subdomain of the second host. (The HSTS     cache either needs to have been populated manually or there needs to have been previous HTTPS accesses     done as the cache needs to have entries for the domains involved to trigger this problem.) When     `x.example.com` responds with `Strict-Transport-Security:` headers; this bug can make the subdomain's     expiry timeout *bleed over* and get set for the parent domain `example.com` in curl's HSTS cache. The     result of a triggered bug is that HTTP accesses to `example.com` get converted to HTTPS for a different     period of time than what was asked for by the origin server. If `example.com` for example stops supporting     HTTPS at its expiry time; curl might then fail to access `http://example.com` until the (wrongly set)     timeout expires. This bug can also expire the parent's entry *earlier*; thus making curl inadvertently     switch back to insecure HTTP earlier than otherwise intended. (CVE-2024-9681)

    (CVE-2024-56171)

  - When curl is asked to use HSTS; the expiry time for a subdomain might overwrite a parent domain's cache     entry; making it end sooner or later than otherwise intended. This affects curl using applications that     enable HSTS and use URLs with the insecure `HTTP://` scheme and perform transfers with hosts like     `x.example.com` as well as `example.com` where the first host is a subdomain of the second host. (The HSTS     cache either needs to have been populated manually or there needs to have been previous HTTPS accesses     done as the cache needs to have entries for the domains involved to trigger this problem.) When     `x.example.com` responds with `Strict-Transport-Security:` headers; this bug can make the subdomain's     expiry timeout *bleed over* and get set for the parent domain `example.com` in curl's HSTS cache. The     result of a triggered bug is that HTTP accesses to `example.com` get converted to HTTPS for a different     period of time than what was asked for by the origin server. If `example.com` for example stops supporting     HTTPS at its expiry time; curl might then fail to access `http://example.com` until the (wrongly set)     timeout expires. This bug can also expire the parent's entry *earlier*; thus making curl inadvertently     switch back to insecure HTTP earlier than otherwise intended. (CVE-2024-9681)

    (CVE-2024-56171)

  - When curl is asked to use HSTS; the expiry time for a subdomain might overwrite a parent domain's cache     entry; making it end sooner or later than otherwise intended. This affects curl using applications that     enable HSTS and use URLs with the insecure `HTTP://` scheme and perform transfers with hosts like     `x.example.com` as well as `example.com` where the first host is a subdomain of the second host. (The HSTS     cache either needs to have been populated manually or there needs to have been previous HTTPS accesses     done as the cache needs to have entries for the domains involved to trigger this problem.) When     `x.example.com` responds with `Strict-Transport-Security:` headers; this bug can make the subdomain's     expiry timeout *bleed over* and get set for the parent domain `example.com` in curl's HSTS cache. The     result of a triggered bug is that HTTP accesses to `example.com` get converted to HTTPS for a different     period of time than what was asked for by the origin server. If `example.com` for example stops supporting     HTTPS at its expiry time; curl might then fail to access `http://example.com` until the (wrongly set)     timeout expires. This bug can also expire the parent's entry *earlier*; thus making curl inadvertently     switch back to insecure HTTP earlier than otherwise intended. (CVE-2024-9681)

(The HSTS     cache either needs to have been populated manually or there needs to have been previous HTTPS accesses     done as the cache needs to have entries for the domains involved to trigger this problem.) When     `x.example.com` responds with `Strict-Transport-Security:` headers; this bug can make the subdomain's     expiry timeout *bleed over* and get set for the parent domain `example.com` in curl's HSTS cache. The     result of a triggered bug is that HTTP accesses to `example.com` get converted to HTTPS for a different     period of time than what was asked for by the origin server. If `example.com` for example stops supporting     HTTPS at its expiry time; curl might then fail to access `http://example.com` until the (wrongly set)     timeout expires. This bug can also expire the parent's entry *earlier*; thus making curl inadvertently     switch back to insecure HTTP earlier than otherwise intended. (CVE-2024-9681)

    (CVE-2024-56171)

  - When curl is asked to use HSTS; the expiry time for a subdomain might overwrite a parent domain's cache     entry; making it end sooner or later than otherwise intended. This affects curl using applications that     enable HSTS and use URLs with the insecure `HTTP://` scheme and perform transfers with hosts like     `x.example.com` as well as `example.com` where the first host is a subdomain of the second host. (The HSTS     cache either needs to have been populated manually or there needs to have been previous HTTPS accesses     done as the cache needs to have entries for the domains involved to trigger this problem.) When     `x.example.com` responds with `Strict-Transport-Security:` headers; this bug can make the subdomain's     expiry timeout *bleed over* and get set for the parent domain `example.com` in curl's HSTS cache. The     result of a triggered bug is that HTTP accesses to `example.com` get converted to HTTPS for a different     period of time than what was asked for by the origin server. If `example.com` for example stops supporting     HTTPS at its expiry time; curl might then fail to access `http://example.com` until the (wrongly set)     timeout expires. This bug can also expire the parent's entry *earlier*; thus making curl inadvertently     switch back to insecure HTTP earlier than otherwise intended. (CVE-2024-9681)

    (CVE-2024-56171)

  - When curl is asked to use HSTS; the expiry time for a subdomain might overwrite a parent domain's cache     entry; making it end sooner or later than otherwise intended. This affects curl using applications that     enable HSTS and use URLs with the insecure `HTTP://` scheme and perform transfers with hosts like     `x.example.com` as well as `example.com` where the first host is a subdomain of the second host. (The HSTS     cache either needs to have been populated manually or there needs to have been previous HTTPS accesses     done as the cache needs to have entries for the domains involved to trigger this problem.) When     `x.example.com` responds with `Strict-Transport-Security:` headers; this bug can make the subdomain's     expiry timeout *bleed over* and get set for the parent domain `example.com` in curl's HSTS cache. The     result of a triggered bug is that HTTP accesses to `example.com` get converted to HTTPS for a different     period of time than what was asked for by the origin server. If `example.com` for example stops supporting     HTTPS at its expiry time; curl might then fail to access `http://example.com` until the (wrongly set)     timeout expires. This bug can also expire the parent's entry *earlier*; thus making curl inadvertently     switch back to insecure HTTP earlier than otherwise intended. (CVE-2024-9681)

(The HSTS     cache either needs to have been populated manually or there needs to have been previous HTTPS accesses     done as the cache needs to have entries for the domains involved to trigger this problem.) When     `x.example.com` responds with `Strict-Transport-Security:` headers; this bug can make the subdomain's     expiry timeout *bleed over* and get set for the parent domain `example.com` in curl's HSTS cache. The     result of a triggered bug is that HTTP accesses to `example.com` get converted to HTTPS for a different     period of time than what was asked for by the origin server. If `example.com` for example stops supporting     HTTPS at its expiry time; curl might then fail to access `http://example.com` until the (wrongly set)     timeout expires. This bug can also expire the parent's entry *earlier*; thus making curl inadvertently     switch back to insecure HTTP earlier than otherwise intended. (CVE-2024-9681)

  - When curl is asked to use HSTS; the expiry time for a subdomain might overwrite a parent domain's cache     entry; making it end sooner or later than otherwise intended. This affects curl using applications that     enable HSTS and use URLs with the insecure `HTTP://` scheme and perform transfers with hosts like     `x.example.com` as well as `example.com` where the first host is a subdomain of the second host. (The HSTS     cache either needs to have been populated manually or there needs to have been previous HTTPS accesses     done as the cache needs to have entries for the domains involved to trigger this problem.) When     `x.example.com` responds with `Strict-Transport-Security:` headers; this bug can make the subdomain's     expiry timeout *bleed over* and get set for the parent domain `example.com` in curl's HSTS cache. The     result of a triggered bug is that HTTP accesses to `example.com` get converted to HTTPS for a different     period of time than what was asked for by the origin server. If `example.com` for example stops supporting     HTTPS at its expiry time; curl might then fail to access `http://example.com` until the (wrongly set)     timeout expires. This bug can also expire the parent's entry *earlier*; thus making curl inadvertently     switch back to insecure HTTP earlier than otherwise intended. (CVE-2024-9681)

    The shim package contains a first-stage UEFI boot loader that handles chaining     to a trusted full boot loader under secure boot environments.

    Security Fix(es):

    * shim: RCE in http boot support may lead to Secure Boot bypass (CVE-2023-40547)

    * shim: Interger overflow leads to heap buffer overflow in verify_sbat_section on 32-bits systems     (CVE-2023-40548)

    * shim: Out-of-bounds read printing error messages (CVE-2023-40546)

    * shim: Out-of-bounds read in verify_buffer_authenticode() malformed PE file (CVE-2023-40549)

    * shim: Out-of-bound read in verify_buffer_sbat() (CVE-2023-40550)

    * shim: out of bounds read when parsing MZ binaries (CVE-2023-40551)

    For more details about the security issue(s); including the impact; a CVSS     score; acknowledgments; and other related information; refer to the CVE page(s) listed in the References     section.

    IMPORTANT: The new shim revokes ALL VERSIONS of GRUB2 before grub2-2.02-0.87.el7_9.14. Therefore GRUB2     MUST be updated to the latest     version: grub2-2.02-0.87.el7_9.14 BEFORE or SIMULTANEOUSLY with this shim in order for Secure Boot to     continue to work. Failure to update GRUB2 will result in an UNBOOTABLE system.

  - Notepad++ is a free and open-source source code editor. In versions 8.8.1 and prior; a privilege escalation     vulnerability exists in the Notepad++ v8.8.1 installer that allows unprivileged users to gain SYSTEM-level     privileges through insecure executable search paths. An attacker could use social engineering or clickjacking to     trick users into downloading both the legitimate installer and a malicious executable to the same directory     (typically Downloads folder - which is known as Vulnerable directory). Upon running the installer; the attack     executes automatically with SYSTEM privileges. This issue has been fixed and will be released in version 8.8.2.

CVE-2025-49144,na1devfocins01,High,7.3,"The version of Notepad++ installed on the remote host is prior to 8.8.2. It is; therefore; affected by a privilege escalation vulnerability:

  - Notepad++ is a free and open-source source code editor. In versions 8.8.1 and prior; a privilege escalation     vulnerability exists in the Notepad++ v8.8.1 installer that allows unprivileged users to gain SYSTEM-level     privileges through insecure executable search paths. An attacker could use social engineering or clickjacking to     trick users into downloading both the legitimate installer and a malicious executable to the same directory     (typically Downloads folder - which is known as Vulnerable directory). Upon running the installer; the attack     executes automatically with SYSTEM privileges. This issue has been fixed and will be released in version 8.8.2.
